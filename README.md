# WorkDays

The problem
- [Farm worker shortage] due to a lack of overseas workers but many workers don't know which farms are looking for people
- a harvest season only lasts a few months -> workers have to find new jobs when it ends
- farms with a different harvest season start to find workers
- all farms have to keep going through recruitment process every time a new fruit season starts


The solution
WorkDays is a solution for solving the issue of

  - Having to repeatedly go through the recruitment process every time a new season starts
  - Having to repeatedly applying for new farm jobs every time a season ends
  
**It's LinkedIn for farmers and more!**

# Features

Farm owners:
  - Request our system to provide them with a list of workers that fits their requirements
  - Publish their farms'profiles for reviews and feedbacks from workers
  - Manage workers and rosters directly on the system

Workers:
  - Submit their experiences, skills and availabilities to the system for processing
  - Receive reviews and feedbacks from employers after their contract ends
 
WorkDays: 
  - Automatically rank workers suitability for a farm based on workers' experiences, skills and feedbacks received
  - Provide farms with the most suitable candidates
  - Has the ability to call in extra workers should a farm needs (for example: in case of unexpected leaves, having extra tasks,...)
  - Automatically process payroll on behalf of employers

# Why?

> WorkDays takes away all the hassels that both farms and workers have to go through years after years. 

>By using WorkDays, farms can simply state their needs such as number of workers, time period or other specific requirements and we will deliver the best candidates for them. Farms do not have to worry about the recruitment proccess, paperwork and payroll anymore. 

> On the other hands, valuable workers will be remembered and offered new opportunities from other farms when their current contracts end. With our automatic payroll feature, workers are also protected from underpayment and missed or late payment. Everyone deserve to have stable income!

### Tech

WorkDays uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Django] - The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines!
* [Twitter Bootstrap4] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [HTML5] - the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML
* [CSS3] - CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course WorkDays itself is open source with a [public repository][wd] on GitHub.
